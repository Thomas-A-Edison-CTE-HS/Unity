### **Activity Guide: Get Started with Audio in Unity**

---

**Objective**:  
In today’s activity, we’ll explore how to create a soundscape in Unity! You will learn how to add audio to a scene, understand the different types of sounds, and consider how to make your project accessible for all players.

---

### **1. Welcome to Creative Core: Audio**
**Objective**: Understand why audio is important in creating immersive experiences.

- **Discussion**: Audio plays a huge role in the atmosphere and experience of interactive media. It can make or break the immersion! Let’s talk about what you think audio adds to a video game or an interactive experience.  
  - **Question to Think About**: Why do you think sound is so important in games? How would the game feel without it?

### **2. Preparing Your Unity Project**
**Objective**: Get Unity set up and ready to work on your sound project.

- **Instructions**:
  1. Make sure you have Unity **2021.3 LTS** installed.
  2. Download the project files from the tutorial page.
  3. Unzip the folder and add it to Unity Hub.
  4. Open the project and go to the **Scenes** folder. Click to open **Audio_Outdoor_Scene**.
  
- **Task**: After opening the scene, **playtest the game** and listen for any audio.  
  - **Question to think about**: Does the scene feel complete with the current audio?

### **3. Understanding Audio in Unity**
**Objective**: Learn how audio works in Unity by exploring Audio Sources and Listeners.

- **Instructions**:
  - Unity uses **Audio Sources** (which make sound) and **Audio Listeners** (which "hear" the sound). 
  - **Task**: Add an **Audio Source** to an object in your scene, like a tree or a door.
  - **Next Step**: Add an **Audio Listener** to the camera in your scene.
  
- **Playtest** the scene again. Move the camera around and listen to how the sounds change as you approach different objects.

### **4. What Does an Audio Engineer Do?**
**Objective**: Understand the role of an audio engineer in creating immersive audio experiences.

- **Instructions**:
  - **Diegetic Sound**: Sounds that exist in the world (like footsteps or wind).
  - **Non-diegetic Sound**: Sounds that don’t exist in the world, but help the audience understand the experience (like background music).
  - **Question**: How can an audio engineer decide whether a sound should be diegetic or non-diegetic?

- **Task**: Look at the scene and decide which sounds would be diegetic or non-diegetic. Can you add both types to your scene?

### **5. Adding Audio to Unity**
**Objective**: Learn how to add audio components to a Unity scene.

- **Instructions**:
  1. Add an **Audio Source** component to different objects in your scene.  
  2. Import audio files into your project and assign them to these Audio Sources.
  3. Make sure the **Audio Listener** is attached to the main camera.
  
- **Task**: Try playing different types of sounds like environmental sounds (wind, footsteps) and see how they affect the mood of the scene.

### **6. Accessibility in Audio**
**Objective**: Consider how audio affects accessibility in your project.

- **Instructions**:
  - For players with hearing impairments, we can add **closed captioning** and other accessibility features to make the experience better.
  - **Task**: Think about how you would add closed captions to your audio.  
    - What sounds are important for your players to understand? How could you help those who can’t hear these sounds?

### **7. Exploring the Soundscape**
**Objective**: Learn how to identify and describe different sounds in an environment.

- **Instructions**:
  - **Exercise**: Find a quiet place and listen carefully. Write down every sound you hear, even if it’s faint.
  - For example, you might hear:  
    - Footsteps  
    - Birds chirping  
    - Wind blowing  
    - Distant traffic
  - **Question**: How can these sounds be used in your game to create a specific atmosphere (e.g., a forest, a city, or a spooky house)?

- **Task**: Add at least 3 different environmental sounds to your scene based on what you heard in the real world.

---

### **8. Playtesting and Adjustments**
**Objective**: Test your scene and adjust the audio for the best experience.

- **Instructions**:
  - After adding your sounds, **playtest your scene** again.
  - **Task**: Adjust the volume of different sounds to make sure none are too loud or too quiet.
  - **Reflection**: How do the sounds you added change the feeling of your scene? Does it feel more immersive? More realistic?

---

### **9. Final Project: Create Your Own Soundscape**
**Objective**: Create a complete soundscape for a new scene using everything you’ve learned.

- **Instructions**:  
  1. Create a new scene or use an existing one.
  2. Add audio sources to objects, like wind, footsteps, or background music.
  3. Adjust each sound to match the environment and mood you want to create.
  
- **Final Task**: Play your scene with the audio, and make any final adjustments. You’ve now created your first soundscape!

### **IEP-Friendly Tips**
- **Visual Aids**: I will provide images of the Unity interface to guide you through each step.
- **Audio Clips**: I’ll play examples of different sounds so you can hear how they work in the game.
- **Reflection**: You’ll have time to reflect on your work with discussion questions and activities that help you think about how sound works in games.

**Reminder**: Don’t hesitate to ask for help if something is unclear, and make sure to have fun experimenting with sound in your Unity projects!
