### **Step 1: Create a Build of Your Game**  
Follow these steps to configure and build your game:

#### **1. Configure Your Build Settings**  
1. Save your scene.
2. Open the **Build Settings** window:  
   - Go to **File > Build Settings** or press **Shift+Ctrl+B** (*Shift+Cmd+B on macOS*).
3. In **Target Platform**, select **Windows, Mac, Linux**.
4. Under **Scenes in Build**, click **Add Open Scenes** to include your Roll-a-Ball game.
5. If **SampleScene** appears, uncheck it to exclude it from the build.

#### **2. Configure Your Player Settings**  
1. Click **Player Settings** to open configuration options.
2. (Optional) Update **Company Name, Product Name, and Version**.
3. Go to **Resolution and Presentation** and set **Fullscreen Mode** to **Windowed**.
4. Adjust the default resolution (e.g., **1024x768** or smaller if necessary).
5. Close the **Project Settings** window.

#### **3. Build Your Game**  
1. Click **Build**.
2. Select a build location:
   - Create a new folder named **Builds** inside your project directory.
   - If using macOS, enter a name for your build.
3. Click **Select Folder (Windows)** or **Save (macOS)**.
4. Unity will compile the game and save it in the **Builds** folder.

#### **4. Play Your Standalone Game!**  
- Navigate to the **Builds** folder and run the executable.
- On macOS, Unity generates an **.app** bundle.
- On Windows, Unity generates an **.exe** file and a corresponding **data folder**.
